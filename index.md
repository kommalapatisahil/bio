I am a Master's student at the University of Washington (UW), studying Mechanical Engineering. My research is held at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Control Theory, and Fluid Mechanics. I am currently a researcher at the [Williams' Laboratory](https://www.williamslaboratory.com/) at the Aerospace department at UW, studying Hairpin structures in Turbulent Boundary layers using Bayesian methods. I was previously a Research Intern at the [Microfluidics Laboratory](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/~amit.agrawal/) at IIT Bombay. Last quarter, I have also been a TA for Paul Allen school of CSE at UW. 

I love biking and hiking around the beautiful Pacific North West.

# I am currently working on the following projects:

1. Using Bayesian Analysis to identify coherent structures in Turbulent boundary layer data. I gave a talk about reviewing my research. Here is the [PPT](https://github.com/kommalapatisahil/kommalapatisahil.github.io/blob/master/files/OwenLabPPT_5_27.pptx) which I used for it.

2. Using Model Predictive Control to stabilize the wake of a Rotating Cylinder. We are using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (with control) to linearize the flow model.[Github Link]

# Selected projects from my previous experiences:

1. My Bachelor's thesis on the stability and Control of an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. [PDF](https://github.com/kommalapatisahil/kommalapatisahil.github.io/blob/master/files/Sahil_Kommalapati_SE422_Report(2).pdf)
2. Here is my review of the Koopman Operator theory for systems in the continuous spectrum. [PDF](https://github.com/kommalapatisahil/kommalapatisahil.github.io/blob/master/files/ME599_Lusch2018_1926528(3).pdf)


# Here is a review of my published original research:

# Other works online:

I truly believe that elegant and clear teaching is a skill that is fundamental to the overall learning process and I thoroughly enjoy it. It strengthens my authority and confidence over the specific material and it ultimately nurtures my abilities towards better scientific communication. So, in that spirit, I have recently picked up the habit of writing about things that I find exciting and impactful. Visit my Medium page on the left (or top, if you are on your phone) to check out some of my articles.


# A call for collaborations.

I believe that the following ideas would be quite challenging to pursue independently. Please reach out to me if you find them relevant to your interests so that we can join forces and work together!

1. Linearizing fluid flow models using Koopman eigenfunctions to control wake shedding around a cylinder. Skills: Deep Learning, Koopman Operator Theory, CFD, python, Matlab-MPC toolbox.

2. Using Cellular Automata and Google Colab notebooks to visualize flow scenarios and prepare engaging notes on introductory Fluid Mechanics. Skills: CUDA, PYTHON, FLUIDS 101.
