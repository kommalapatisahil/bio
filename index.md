I am a Master's student at the University of Washington (UW), studying Mechanical Engineering. My research is held at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Control Theory and Fluid Mechanics. I am currently a researcher at the [Williams' Laboratory](https://www.williamslaboratory.com/) at the Aerospace department at UW, studying Hairpin structures in Turbulent Boundary layers using Bayesian methods. I was previously a research Intern at the [Microfluidics Laboratory](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/~amit.agrawal/) at IIT Bombay. Last quarter, I have also been a TA for for Paul Allen school of CSE at UW. 

I love biking and hiking around the beautiful Pacific North West.

# Current projects which keep me busy:

1. Using Bayesian Analysis to identify coherent structures in Turbulent boundary layer data. I gave a talk reviewing my research. Here is the [PPT](https://github.com/kommalapatisahil/kommalapatisahil.github.io/blob/master/files/OwenLabPPT_5_27.pptx) which I used for it.

2. Using Model Predictive Control to stabilize the wake of a rotating Cylinder. We are using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (with control) to linearize the flow model.[Github Link]

# Older projects:

1. My Bachelor's thesis on the stability and Control of an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. [PDF](https://github.com/kommalapatisahil/kommalapatisahil.github.io/blob/master/files/Sahil_Kommalapati_SE422_Report(2).pdf)
2. Here is my review of Koopman Operator theory for systems in continuous spectrum. [PDF](https://github.com/kommalapatisahil/kommalapatisahil.github.io/blob/master/files/ME599_Lusch2018_1926528(3).pdf)

# More writting online

I truly believe that teaching something is an essential part of learning it. So, in that spirit I have recently picked up the habit writting about things which I find exciting and impactful. Check out the links on the left half of this page!

# Call for colloborations
I have a couple of Ideas on which I have been looking for more people to join me: 

1. Linearizing fluid flow models using Koopman eigen functions to control flow around a cylinder. Skills: Deep Learning, Koopman Operator Theory, CFD, python, Matlab-MPC toolbox.

2. Using Cellular Automata and Google Colab notebooks to visualize flow data for preparing exciting review notes on introductory Fluid Mechanics. Skills: CUDA, PYTHON, FLUIDS 101. 

If you are Interested any of the above, reach out to me. Or, If it's reevant to my interests, tell me about your ideas and let's bring them to life. Or, just hit me up to talk about Politics and Philisophy!
